- Learn Kubernetes
 - Courses from pluralsight:
  - Getting started with Kubernetes
  - [TODO] Kubernetes for Developers: Integrating Volumes and Using Multi-container Pods 

## K8s Architecture
- ### Masters
 - Also known as head nodes or the control plane
 - Multi-master control plane
 - H/A Design/Config (3 is the magic number in most cases).
 - Split brain (4 can cause this).
 - Need 1 or more linux machines to control masters.
 - Out of your control in hosted k8s control plane, only an api is exposed.
 - Best Practice: master should only control operations, nodes should control the user/business app.
 - What makes the master?
  - kube-apiserver
   - front-end to the control plane
   - exposes the api (REST)
   - consumes JSON/YAML
 - cluster store
  - persists cluster state and config
  - based on etcd 
  - performance is critical
  - have recovery plans in place
 - kube-controller-manager
  - controller of controllers
   - node controller
   - deployment controller
   - endpoints/endpointslice controller
  - watch loops
  - reconciles observed state with desired state
 - kube-scheduler
  - watches api server for new work tasks
  - assigns work to cluser nodes
   - affinity/anti-affinity
   - constraints
   - taints
   - resources
- ### Nodes - alternative virtual kubelet
 - kubelet
  - main kubernetes agent
  - registers node with cluster
  - watches api server for work tasks (pods)
  - executes pods
  - reports back to masters
 - container runtime
  - can be docker
  - pluggable: container runtime interface (CRI)
   - docker, containerd, cri-o, kata
  - low-level container intelligence
 - kube-proxy
  - networking component
  - pod ip addresses
  - basic load-balancing
- ### Pods
 - Essentially a container wrapper
 - Scale pods, not containers!
 - Pod scheduled to single node
 - Pods are mortal
 - Annotations, labels, policies, resources, co-scheduling containers
- ### Deployments
 - Deployment Controller/Reconciliation loop
  - Watches api server for new deployments
  - implements them
  - constantly compares observerd state with desired state
 - DEFCON 1: Rectifies failing pod
 - Replica Set Controller
 - Replica is a pod
 - Makes sure desired state matches observed state

- ### Declarative model
 - Describe what you want (desired state) in a manifest file

- ### Stable Networking with K8s Service
 - Only sends traffic to healthy pods
 - Can do session affinity
 - Can send traffic to endpoints outside the cluster
 - Can do TCP and UDP

- ### K8s Api & Api Service
 - Catalog of features
  - core: pod, cm, ep, svc, vol, ns
  - workloads/apps: deploy, ds, rs, sts
  - storage: sc, pv, pvc
  - networking: ing, netpol
